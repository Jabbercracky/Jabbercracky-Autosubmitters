# Jabbercracky Autosubmitters

This repository contains a collection of autosubmitters for the Jabbercracky
hash-cracking platform. These autosubmitters are designed to automatically
submit solutions to the Jabbercracky platform.

Jabbercracky is a community hash-cracking site designed for people of all skill levels. Seasonally, the Jabbercracky team hosts hash-cracking events, where we provide several created hash challenges for players to crack. When the events are not active, players can practice cracking past hash lists and continue to earn points and loot.
